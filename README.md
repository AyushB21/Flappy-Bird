# Flappy Bird AI

This repository contains the code for a Flappy Bird game clone with an AI that learns to play the game using a neural network and genetic algorithm.

## Files and Directories

- `config-feedforward.txt`: Configuration for the neural network model.
- `flappy_bird.py`: The main game script.
- `imgs/`: Directory containing images used in the game.
- `__pycache__/`: Compiled Python files that are created during runtime.
- `requirements.txt`: The required libraries for running the project.
- `visualize.py`: Script for visualizing the performance of the AI.

## Setup

To set up the project, you need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

To run the game, execute the `flappy_bird.py` script:

```bash
python flappy_bird.py
```

## AI and Learning

The AI uses a neural network configured in `config-feedforward.txt` and evolves over time using a genetic algorithm to improve its gameplay.
